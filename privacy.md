# YT Digest â€“ Privacy Policy

*Last updated: September 2025*

YT Digest respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Information We Collect

- **Authentication data** (such as your Google account ID or email) when you sign in, for the purpose of enabling premium features in the future.
- **Extension settings** (such as preferences for transcript view, summarization mode, or UI options) stored locally in your browser using Chrome Storage.
- **Transcript text** from YouTube videos you open. This data is processed locally in your browser to generate transcripts, enable search, jump to timestamps, and optionally open ChatGPT for summarization.

---

## How We Use Information

- To provide the core functionality of the extension (transcription, search, timestamps, summarization).
- To recognize you when you sign in and enable future premium features.
- To remember your preferences and settings.

---

## Data We Do Not Collect

- We do not collect or store your browsing history.
- We do not collect personal communications, health, financial, or location data.
- We do not sell, rent, or transfer your data to third parties.

## Third-Party Services

- When you choose the summarization feature, YT Digest opens ChatGPT ([https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)) in a new tab and autofills the transcript text. Transcript data is shared with ChatGPT only when you opt into this feature.
- If you sign in with Google, Googleâ€™s authentication service handles your login. Please review [Googleâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.

---

## Your Choices

- You may use the extension without signing in (free features).
- You can clear stored data (preferences and cache) anytime through Chromeâ€™s extension settings.
- If you do not wish to use ChatGPT summarization, you can simply avoid clicking the summarization button.
